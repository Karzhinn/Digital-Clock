# Digital-Clock

A Digital clock programmed in java.
This project was to warm up again after a long break i had with any programming, it's very simple and easy to make changes to it.
This project was initially built on (NetBeans) but last test was on VScode.
To change the Format of the Time and Date search about Java SimpleDateFormat.
on VScode you may need some extentions that don't come by default with VScode, Every used library is Java default libraries.
